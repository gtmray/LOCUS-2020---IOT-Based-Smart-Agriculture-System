This was a group project for Nepal's biggest technological event LOCUS 👩‍💻 . The project achieves automatic as well as manual ways of farming🎍. The soil and environment condition is checked in real-time by the sensors and the microcontroller sends the data to firebase. Then, the data from firebase is retrieved by our android app 📱 so that we can analyze and control accordingly.
